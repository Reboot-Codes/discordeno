# Gateway Proxy (Cache)

This proxy is designed to cache everything possible and send it down to you when you connect so your bot has all the necessary information cached that you want for your bot.

# Setup

Once you have cloned this proxy, make sure to go inside `src/structures/` and delete all the lines which your bot does not need.

Before your bot starts listening for events, you can request to prefill your bots cache and all the data will be sent to you first.
